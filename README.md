# Longest-Compound
Longest-Compund result


Here is my attempt at the Longest-Compound challenge.

There are some notes in the code for better understanding in the attempt.

Essentially what I tried to do is establish the longest of the words in the set of words (s) then use that word as the end point for the words in the list.

From here I used my function n = s.length () and used a boolean array called dp = new boolean [n + 1] to build the words.
